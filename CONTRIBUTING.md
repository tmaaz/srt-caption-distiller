# Contributing to SRT Caption Distiller
Thanks for your time and interest in contributing! The following are mainly guidelines, not steadfast rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs
Please perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible; better to over-explain than not explain enough. 

If you find an issue labeled "Closed" that seems like it's the same thing that you're experiencing, please open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## Suggestions
Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the README and perform a cursory search, as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible.

## Pull Requests
We want to keep this as simple as possible, while fixing any problems that are important to users. Let's work together to create the best possible solution for them.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, please follow standard Python coding conventions, and make sure to keep all of your commits to one feature per commit. Please include a clear log message for your commits; I would rather read a paragraph that explains the minute details than a sentence that leaves me guessing.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
